Architecture:

This application utilizes a variety of technologies including Express HTML, JavaScript, and Angular SPA. Express is used to create the customer facing website in conjunction with JavaScript to add interactivity and task handling. The admin interface is designed on Angular and allows for updating of the website. The backend utilizes MongoDB to store the data due to its flexibility to store different types of information.

Functionality:

JSON is a data format that is understandable by both the front-end JavaScript and back-end MongoDB to interact with. This allows for a smooth transfer of data between the front and back-end. This also allowed for refactoring of code such as the initial HTML code that was copied over to the Angular SPA side to be used by admin. In addition, many website variables such as the trip cards were created as reusable UI components to reduce code redundancy.

Testing: 

Testing was an important aspect to ensure smooth operation of the website. API endpoints were tested using various methods tools such as Postman and MongoDB Compass to verify the transfer of information. Security features such as admin log in authentication allows for a more secure access and less likeliness of a breach.

Reflection:

This course has helped contribute to my professional development in numerous ways. I got to work with tools that were new to me such as Postman and MongoDB Compass. I gained a deeper understanding of full stack development and how the different front and back-end technologies are connected. It also helped greatly with debugging code in scenarios that are new to me.
